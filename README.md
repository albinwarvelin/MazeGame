# Mazegame
Mazegame is a final project for my programming course, using Monogame XNA v3.8.
## Gameplay - How to
The objective is simple, finish as many levels in a randomly generated maze as possible without the time running out. Both the amount of time and the size of your maze increases each level, however while the size increases exponentially, time doesn't. Walk around with your character and utilize your speedboost to find the golden endportal within the time limit
### Known troubles
When trying to open project debugging for the first time on a new device Monogame XNA might give errors stating that there isn't any dependencies available or that they don't work. Trying to reinstall though NuGet might work however i've had problems with it and I find that the easiset way is to copy classes to a new clean Monogame project, it's not ideal but it works.
